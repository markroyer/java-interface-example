# java-interface-example

A simple Java program that uses Swing and Java2D to help students
understand the concept of Java interfaces.

The program is a JFrame that contains shapes. Created shapes can be
dragged around the top panel using the left mouse button and can be
double clicked on. This program is meant to show students how an
interface (ClickableShape) may be used to create new object types with
minimal refactoring.

Try creating a ClickableRectangle class that extends the
ClickableShape interface.  Use the ClickableTriangle class as a
reference.

The application also demonstrates the use of Swing, Java2D, and Java
Core Reflection.
