# java-interface-example

A simple Java program that uses Swing and Java2D to help students
understand the concept of Java interfaces.

The program is a `JFrame` that contains shapes. Created shapes can be
dragged around the top panel using the left mouse button and can be
double clicked on. This program is meant to show students how an
interface (`ClickableShape`) may be used to create new object types with
minimal refactoring.

Try creating a `ClickableRectangle` class that extends the
`ClickableShape` interface.  Use the `ClickableTriangle` class as a
reference.

The application also demonstrates the use of Swing, Java2D, and Java
Core Reflection.

## Screenshots
